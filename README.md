# Agility of Tunnel-based and SDN-based Approaches in Rerouting-based Traffic Engineering

** Project Goal:** A network policy can be enforced by network operators by introducing the policies at the edge nodes or by distributing them across the network. The goal of this project is to compare the two approaches and to find out which approach enables more capabilities in the network and the disruptions caused while changing the network-wide policies.
