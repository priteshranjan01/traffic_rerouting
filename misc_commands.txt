## ExoGENI TIPs
### 1. If we give IP address while reserving the ExoGENI node then after the nodes boot up the interfaces can't be
###    assigned new IP addresses. This is because ExoGENI nodes run a service called "neuca" that manage network
###    interfaces on the nodes. Source. Section 5.3
###    [http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIExperimenter/Tutorials/jacks/GettingStarted_PartI/Procedure/Execute]
###    Stop the neuca service and the the IP addresses can be assigned. do `sudo service neuca stop`

### 2. If we don't give the IP addresses to the interfaces to the ExoGENI nodes then figuring out which interface is
###    on which link won't be obvious. And if we have a network where multiple nodes have multiple connecting links
###    then there will be a lot of permutations to try. A workaround is to give dummy static IP addresses while reserving
###    resources, note the "link <-> IP address" pair and then when the systems boot up do an ifconfig to get IP address
###    <-> interface pair. Using these two tuples we can figure link <-> interfaces pair.
###    If we want to give new IP addresses then refer to TIP #1.

## Wireshark version 2.2.0
#### sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable
#### sudo apt-get update
#### sudo apt-get install wireshark

## TCP-DUMP (because sometimes Wireshark is not an option)
Quick cheat-sheet: https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/
tcpdump -i eth1  # Listen for all packets on interface eth1


## Generic commands.

### Temporarily Assign Ip address to interfaces.
ifconfig <interface> <ip>/<netmask>

### Stop the network-manager in order to be able to prevent it interfering when you assign ip addresses.
service network-manager stop

### To enable ip forwarding in linux, use the command. 
### DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS. OR ELSE YOU WILL SPEND SLEEP LESS NIGHTS DEBUGGING YOUR NETWORK.
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

### To add routing table entry use the command
sudo route add -net <dest-network-address> netmask <netmask> gw <gateway>
sudo route del -net <dest-network-address> netmask <netmask> 
### NEVER ADD A DEFAULT ROUTE TO GENI NODEs. Default route is used for management access to the nodes.
#### Anyways, to add default gateway use the command
sudo route add default gw <gateway>


## OVS-commands: 

### Add bridge
ovs-vsctl add-br br0

### Add port
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth1

### Bridge can be given an IP address as any regular interface.
ifocnfig br0 192.168.10.1/24

### set-fail-mode at the OVS.
#### Do normal switching when disconnected from controller.
ovs-vsctl set-fail-mode br0 standalone

#### Do nothing without a controller.
ovs-vsctl set-fail-mode br0 secure 

### Configure OF Version 14 on OVS switch.
ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 protocols=OpenFlow14

### Set controller information at the OpenVswitch.
ovs-vsctl set-controller br0 tcp:192.168.20.1:6633

### Delete controller from bridge 
ovs-vsctl del-controller br0
